  * Input: no input necessary
  * Output: function Pizza(size, topping1, topping2, topping3) {this.size, this.topping1, this.topping2, this.topping3}

2. Create prototype to calculate price of pizza
  * Input: no input necessary
  * Output: small: $14.99, medium: 18.99 large: 22.99

3. Create prototype that adds 12.00 to the pizza size to account for the added toppings
  * Input: size: small, topping1: anchovy, topping2: artichoke, topping3: cheese
